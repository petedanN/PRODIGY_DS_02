# Task 02 - Data Cleaning and EDA on Titanic Dataset

## Objective
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to explore variable relationships and identify trends.

## Dataset
Source: [Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%202)

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Filled missing Age with median
   - Filled missing Embarked with mode
   - Dropped Cabin (too many missing values)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Survival distribution
   - Gender vs survival
   - Age distribution
   - Passenger class vs survival
   - Correlation heatmap

## Key Insights
- Females survived more than males.
- Upper-class passengers had higher survival rates.
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances.
- Survival correlated with passenger class and gender.
